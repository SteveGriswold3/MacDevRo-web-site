      <h3>Decision Trees</h3>
      <h4>June 22, 2018</h4>
      <p>Coming to the end of Week 1, much of the information is starting to
        come together.  I have been reading the book Data Science for Business.
        The topic has followed scenarios such as customer churn and account
         write-off.  In thinking about predictive analytics, which attributes 
         coorelate to the target value.
      </p>
      <p>Back in the class room we dabled in using the Terminal to look at 
        parts of the information.  However I was most excited to start practicing 
        some decision tree logic.  We used a scatter matrix to begin to look at 
        the data.  I took the analysis further by beginning to practice the 
        Shannon's Entropy Formula to determine which attribute has the most 
        information gain.  Next I would like to build my own python funciton to 
        provide me with information gain as a chart.

      <h3>matplotlib</h3>
      <h4>June 21, 2018</h4>
      <p>The below is a set of charts created using Python3 and matplotlib.  One line is the equation y=3x+0.5 and the other line y = 5 * sqrt(x).
        I used np.arrange(0, 5, 0.01) to create an array to calculate the y-values.  With a equal set of values, the plot
        is ready to be displayed:</p>
